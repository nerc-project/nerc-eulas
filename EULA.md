The Mass Open Cloud Alliance (MOC Alliance) has developed a production
public cloud to provide domain researchers with predictable low-cost
resources and facilitator support while enabling academic researchers
and developers in the open source community to participate in close
interactions between research, development, and production operations.
Housed at the Boston University Hariri Institute for Computing and
Computational Science & Engineering, the MOC Alliance is a unique
collaborative effort between higher education, non-profit entities and
industry (MOC Alliance Collaborators). For a full list of the MOC

Services.

## Intellectual Property

The Services allow you to upload, store, download, access, and share
content (“User Content”). You retain ownership of any and all
intellectual property rights you hold in your User Content.

By using the Service, you give the Provider a nonexclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free license to host and store the User Content that you upload,
store, download, access, and share, as well as a license to perform
those tasks necessary to ensure continued operation of the Services.

The Provider retains all legal right, title, and interest in and to the
Services, including but not limited to graphics, user interface, the
scripts and software used to implement the Services, and any materials
provided to you as a part of and/or in connection with the Services,
including any and all intellectual property rights that exist therein,
whether registered or not, and wherever in the world they may exist.

## Code of Conduct

   the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of
   Commerce; or

18. use or access the Services in any way that would make the Provider

   requiring the Provider to take affirmative steps in order to store,
   access, use, transfer, or otherwise process particular User Content
   that includes personal information of individuals or other sensitive
   information legally (e.g., the EU's General Data Protection
   Regulation, China's Personal Information Protection Law, the U.S.'s
   HIPAA#. .

## Removal of Content

The Provider assumes no liability for any content uploaded to or stored
on the Services by other parties. However, the Provider reserves the
right at all times to determine whether any content violates this
Agreement, and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify, and/or remove
content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion.

## Copyright

You agree to refrain from any and all copyright infringement in your use
of the Services. The Provider will respond to notices of copyright
infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be
reported using the Provider's Digital Millennium Copyright Act
procedures, which are available in the [contact information
section](#contact-information). The Provider reserves the right to remove without
notice any content that is alleged to be infringing and to terminate the
accounts of repeat infringers. The designated agent for notice of alleged
copyright infringement on the Services is identified here.

## Enforcement

If you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, or if your use of the
Services intentionally or unintentionally threatens the Provider's
ability to provide the Services or other systems, the Provider may
immediately take any action necessary to ensure compliance with this
Agreement and the protection of the Services or the Provider's systems,
up to and including termination or suspension of your access to the
Services and deletion of your content.

## Provider's Warranties and Disclaimers

The Provider agrees to provide the Services using a reasonable level of
skill and care. However, other than as expressly set out in this
Agreement, the Provider makes no warranty, guarantee or promise relating
to the Services. For example, and without limitation, the Provider makes
no representations or commitments regarding the specific functions of
the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet
your needs. THE PROVIDER PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
AVAILABLE” BASIS.

The Services may be unavailable from time to time. While the Provider's
goal is the keep the Services up and running, all online services suffer
occasional disruptions and outages, and the Provider is not liable for
any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. The Provider
specifically makes no warranties related to “uptime” or your ability to
access content stored on the Services during any period that the
Services are unavailable. As such, the Provider recommends that you
regularly back up content stored on the Services to another storage
medium.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
WARRANTIES NOT EXPLICITLY GRANTED HEREIN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## Personal Data and Other Confidential Information

To the extent your use of the Services requires it, you are responsible
for providing notice to, and obtaining consents from, individuals
regarding the collection, processing, transfer and storage of their data
through your use of the Services.

You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any
liabilities, fines and penalties arising from your failure to comply
with this Section 8 and any other provision of this Agreement.

## Telemetry Data

For the purposes of this Agreement, “telemetry data” shall mean any
information related to your utilization of the Services.

You acknowledge and agree that the Services will collect and transmit
telemetry data to MOC Alliance and its higher education, non-profit and
industry MOC Alliance Collaborators. MOC Alliance and its MOC Alliance
Collaborators may use telemetry data to operate and maintain (including
to improve) the Services and for scientific research purposes.

Telemetry data will generally not include personal, identifiable
information. You acknowledge that some of the telemetry data, such as IP
address, MAC address and email address, may qualify as personal data
identifying an individual under the laws of some jurisdictions.

Requests by third parties other than Provider and MOC Alliance
Collaborators to access telemetry data for any purpose must be reviewed
and approved by the MOC Alliance Data Governance Committee. MOC Alliance
may also post and make broadly available some telemetry data in an
anonymized manner on the Internet.

## Limitation of Liability

The Provider will use reasonable security measures to protect content
stored on the Services. However, the Provider makes no guarantees that
the Services will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses,
interference, hacking, or other security intrusion, and the Provider
disclaims any liability relating thereto.

AS PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST
PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR IN ANY WAY
ATTRIBUTABLE TO USE OF THE SERVICES. FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, THE
PROVIDER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OR BREACH OF YOUR USER
CONTENT.

## Provider's Right to Update Services

The Provider reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and
to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the
Services. Any material modifications and additional terms and conditions
will be communicated to you and, if accepted, will be effective
immediately and will be incorporated into this Agreement. In the event
that you refuse to accept such changes, the Provider will have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.

## Termination of the Agreement

This Agreement may be terminated by you at any time by discontinuing your use
of the Service and deleting your User Content or by written notice to the
Provider's technical/support contact listed in the [contact information
section](#contact-information). In such an event, the Provider may immediately
terminate your account, but it may take up to 10 business days to do so. You
should ensure prior to termination that you have transferred all data stored on
the Services to another storage medium.

This Agreement may be terminated by the Provider for any reason upon 48 hours’
notice to you. In such an event, you will be afforded a reasonable opportunity
to retrieve your User Content from the Services. If your account access has
been suspended pursuant to Section 6, you may request to retrieve your User
Content from the Services by emailing Provider's technical/support contact
listed in the [contact information section](#contact-information). The Provider
will take reasonable steps to arrange for you to retrieve such content,
provided retrieval does not require an unreasonable amount of Provider's time
or resources and that the content is not illegal; is not unlawfully
pornographic or indecent; does not depict extreme acts of violence; does not
advocate bigotry or hatred against any person or group of people based on their
race, religion, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, disability,
or impairment; and does not violate the privacy or infringe the rights of
others). Any such retrieval shall be at your own expense.

## Severability

If any part of this Agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the
remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.

## Governing Law

This Agreement, and the interpretation, construction and enforceability
hereof, and all rights and obligations of both you and the Provider,
whether arising under this Agreement or otherwise, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, without giving effect to its principles of conflict of
laws. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for resolution of
any disputes under this Agreement shall be in the state and federal
courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and you hereby submit to, and
waive objection to, the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
