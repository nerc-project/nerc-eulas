The Mass Open Cloud Alliance (MOC Alliance) has developed a production
public cloud to provide domain researchers with predictable low-cost
resources and facilitator support while enabling academic researchers
and developers in the open source community to participate in close
interactions between research, development, and production operations.
Housed at the Boston University Hariri Institute for Computing and
Computational Science & Engineering, the MOC Alliance is a unique
collaborative effort between higher education, non-profit entities and
industry (MOC Alliance Collaborators). For a full list of the MOC
Alliance Collaborators, please visit

# MASS OPEN CLOUD ALLIANCE (MOC ALLIANCE) END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”) applies to all uses of
software and services rendered by and in relation to the Mass Open Cloud
Alliance (the “Services”). Each Service is provided and managed by the MOC
Alliance Collaborator(s) identified in [the list of providers](#providers)
(each a “Provider”). The Providers may change this Agreement at any time, and
we will try to let you know as soon as possible about any new changes. If you
do not wish to accept the new Agreement, you must immediately stop using the
Services and terminate this Agreement pursuant to [Termination of the
Agreement](#termination-of-the-agreement).

## Description of the Services

The Services are a cloud-based system through which users can upload,
store, download, and share content from servers maintained by the
Provider. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES AN ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN. If you do not
agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, you may not use the
Services.

## Intellectual Property

The Services allow you to upload, store, download, access, and share
content (“User Content”). You retain ownership of any and all
intellectual property rights you hold in your User Content.

By using the Service, you give the Provider a nonexclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free license to host and store the User Content that you upload,
store, download, access, and share, as well as a license to perform
those tasks necessary to ensure continued operation of the Services.

The Provider retains all legal right, title, and interest in and to the
Services, including but not limited to graphics, user interface, the
scripts and software used to implement the Services, and any materials
provided to you as a part of and/or in connection with the Services,
including any and all intellectual property rights that exist therein,
whether registered or not, and wherever in the world they may exist.

## Code of Conduct

In exchange for your right to use the Services, you agree not to misuse
the Services or to help anyone else to do so. In particular, you agree
to not do any of the following with respect to the Services (unless
otherwise authorized in writing by the Provider for a specified research
purpose):

1. probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network;

2. breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication
   measures;

3. willfully access, tamper with, or use non-public areas or parts of
   the Services, or shared areas of the Services you haven't been given
   access to;

4. willfully interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for
   example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or
   mail-bombing any part of the Services;

5. access, search, or create accounts for the Services by any means
   other than the Provider's publicly supported interfaces (for
   example, "scraping" or creating accounts in bulk);

6. send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or
   spam;

7. send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information,
   including "spoofing" or "phishing";

8. promote or advertise products or services without appropriate
   authorization;

9. circumvent quotas, including computer, networking and storage
   limits;

10. sell the Services unless specifically authorized to do so;

11. publish or share materials that are unlawfully pornographic or
   indecent, or that contain extreme acts of violence;

12. advocate bigotry or hatred against any person or group of people
   based on their race, religion, ethnicity, sex, gender identity,
   sexual preference, disability, or impairment;

13. violate the law in any way, including storing, publishing or sharing
   material that is fraudulent, defamatory, or misleading;

14. violate the privacy or infringe the rights (including those rights
   granted under trademark and copyright law) of others;

15. use any component, function, or other facility of the Services to
   store, access, transmit, or share any “personal information” of
   individuals (as such term is defined in Section 1 of M.G.L. c. 93H);

16. If you are a covered entity, business associate, or representative
   of a covered entity or business associate (as those terms are
   defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
   of 1996 (“HIPAA”) at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103), use any component,
   function, or other facility of the Services to store, access,
   transmit, or share any “protected health information” (as such term
   is defined at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103) or use the Services in any manner
   that would make the Provider your or any third party's business
   associate;

17. access the Services from sanctioned countries, per the list kept by
   the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of
   Commerce; or

18. use or access the Services in any way that would make the Provider
   subject to the law of any jurisdiction outside of the United States
   requiring the Provider to take affirmative steps in order to store,
   access, use, transfer, or otherwise process particular User Content
   that includes personal information of individuals or other sensitive
   information legally (e.g., the EU's General Data Protection
   Regulation, China's Personal Information Protection Law, the U.S.'s
   HIPAA).

## Removal of Content

The Provider assumes no liability for any content uploaded to or stored
on the Services by other parties. However, the Provider reserves the
right at all times to determine whether any content violates this
Agreement, and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify, and/or remove
content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion.

## Copyright

You agree to refrain from any and all copyright infringement in your use of the
Services. The Provider will respond to notices of copyright infringement if
they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using the
Provider's Digital Millennium Copyright Act procedures, which are available in
the [list of providers](#providers). The Provider reserves the right to remove
without notice any content that is alleged to be infringing and to terminate
the accounts of repeat infringers. The designated agent for notice of alleged
copyright infringement on the Services is identified in [the list of
providers](#providers).

## Enforcement

If you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, or if your use of the
Services intentionally or unintentionally threatens the Provider's
ability to provide the Services or other systems, the Provider may
immediately take any action necessary to ensure compliance with this
Agreement and the protection of the Services or the Provider's systems,
up to and including termination or suspension of your access to the
Services and deletion of your content.

## Provider's Warranties and Disclaimers

The Provider agrees to provide the Services using a reasonable level of
skill and care. However, other than as expressly set out in this
Agreement, the Provider makes no warranty, guarantee or promise relating
to the Services. For example, and without limitation, the Provider makes
no representations or commitments regarding the specific functions of
the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet
your needs. THE PROVIDER PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
AVAILABLE” BASIS.

The Services may be unavailable from time to time. While the Provider's
goal is the keep the Services up and running, all online services suffer
occasional disruptions and outages, and the Provider is not liable for
any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. The Provider
specifically makes no warranties related to “uptime” or your ability to
access content stored on the Services during any period that the
Services are unavailable. As such, the Provider recommends that you
regularly back up content stored on the Services to another storage
medium.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
WARRANTIES NOT EXPLICITLY GRANTED HEREIN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## Personal Data and Other Confidential Information

To the extent your use of the Services requires it, you are responsible
for providing notice to, and obtaining consents from, individuals
regarding the collection, processing, transfer and storage of their data
through your use of the Services.

You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any
liabilities, fines and penalties arising from your failure to comply
with this section of the document and any other provision of this Agreement.

## Telemetry Data

For the purposes of this Agreement, “telemetry data” shall mean any
information related to your utilization of the Services.

You acknowledge and agree that the Services will collect and transmit
telemetry data to MOC Alliance and its higher education, non-profit and
industry MOC Alliance Collaborators. MOC Alliance and its MOC Alliance
Collaborators may use telemetry data to operate and maintain (including
to improve) the Services and for scientific research purposes.

Telemetry data will generally not include personal, identifiable
information. You acknowledge that some of the telemetry data, such as IP
address, MAC address and email address, may qualify as personal data
identifying an individual under the laws of some jurisdictions.

Requests by third parties other than Provider and MOC Alliance
Collaborators to access telemetry data for any purpose must be reviewed
and approved by the MOC Alliance Data Governance Committee. MOC Alliance
may also post and make broadly available some telemetry data in an
anonymized manner on the Internet.

## Limitation of Liability

The Provider will use reasonable security measures to protect content
stored on the Services. However, the Provider makes no guarantees that
the Services will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses,
interference, hacking, or other security intrusion, and the Provider
disclaims any liability relating thereto.

AS PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST
PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR IN ANY WAY
ATTRIBUTABLE TO USE OF THE SERVICES. FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, THE
PROVIDER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OR BREACH OF YOUR USER
CONTENT.

## Provider's Right to Update Services

The Provider reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to
impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Services. Any
material modifications and additional terms and conditions will be communicated
to you and, if accepted, will be effective immediately and will be incorporated
into this Agreement. In the event that you refuse to accept such changes, the
Provider will have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
[Termination of the Agreement](#termination-of-the-agreement).

## Termination of the Agreement

This Agreement may be terminated by you at any time by discontinuing your use
of the Service and deleting your User Content or by written notice to the
Provider's technical/support contact listed in the [list of
providers](#providers). In such an event, the Provider may immediately
terminate your account, but it may take up to 10 business days to do so. You
should ensure prior to termination that you have transferred all data stored on
the Services to another storage medium.

This Agreement may be terminated by the Provider for any reason upon 48 hours
notice to you. In such an event, you will be afforded a reasonable opportunity
to retrieve your User Content from the Services. If your account access has
been suspended pursuant to [Enforcement](#enforcement), you may request to retrieve your User
Content from the Services by emailing Provider's technical/support contact
listed in the [list of providers](#providers). The Provider will take
reasonable steps to arrange for you to retrieve such content, provided
retrieval does not require an unreasonable amount of Provider's time or
resources and that the content is not illegal; is not unlawfully pornographic
or indecent; does not depict extreme acts of violence; does not advocate
bigotry or hatred against any person or group of people based on their race,
religion, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, disability, or
impairment; and does not violate the privacy or infringe the rights of others).
Any such retrieval shall be at your own expense.

## Severability

If any part of this Agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the
remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.

## Governing Law

This Agreement, and the interpretation, construction and enforceability
hereof, and all rights and obligations of both you and the Provider,
whether arising under this Agreement or otherwise, shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, without giving effect to its principles of conflict of
laws. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for resolution of
any disputes under this Agreement shall be in the state and federal
courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and you hereby submit to, and
waive objection to, the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
