## Removal of Content

The Provider assumes no liability for any User Content or content uploaded to or stored on the Services by other parties. However, the Provider reserves the right at all times to determine whether any User Content violates this Agreement, and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify, delete, and/or remove content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion.

## Copyright

You agree to refrain from any and all copyright infringement in your use of the Services. The Provider will respond to notices of copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using the Provider’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act procedures, which are available [here](#information-to-be-provided-at-link-example). The Provider reserves the right to remove without notice any content that is alleged to be infringing and to delete the accounts of repeat infringers.

## Enforcement

If you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, or if your use of the Services intentionally or unintentionally threatens the Provider’s ability to provide the Services or other systems, the Provider may immediately take any action necessary to ensure compliance with this Agreement and the protection of the Services or the Provider’s systems, up to and including termination or suspension of your access to the Services and deletion of User Content.

## Other Circumstances

The Provider reserves the right to exercise judgment with respect to the use of the Services and its resources and to restrict or terminate access to you as it sees fit.  

## Provider’s Warranties and Disclaimers

The Provider agrees to provide the Services using a reasonable level of skill and care. However, other than as expressly set out in this Agreement, the Provider makes no warranty, guarantee or promise relating to the Services. For example, and without limitation, the Provider makes no representations or commitments regarding the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. THE PROVIDER PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. With respect to any User Content, it is your responsibility to make copies of such data to another storage medium.

The Services may be unavailable from time to time. While the Provider’s goal is the keep the Services up and running, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and the Provider is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. The Provider specifically makes no warranties related to “uptime” or your ability to access User Content during any period that the Services are unavailable. As such, the Provider recommends that you implement and maintain a current back up of User Content in another storage medium.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER TERMS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE NOT EXPLICITLY GRANTED HEREIN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF QUALITY, TITLE, FITNESS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, IN RELATION TO THE SERVICES.

## Personal Data and Other Confidential Information

You are responsible for providing notice to, and obtaining consents from, individuals regarding the collection, processing, transfer and storage of their data through your use of the Services or included in User Content.

You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any claims, damages, liabilities, fines and penalties arising from your failure to comply with this “Personal Data and Other Confidential Information” Section and any other provision of this Agreement.

## Telemetry Data

Provider may collect information related to your utilization of the Services (“telemetry data”). Telemetry data includes information like metadata, general usage data, session data, log data, and device information.  Telemetry data may also include some personal, identifiable information, such as IP addresses, MAC addresses and email addresses, which may qualify as personal data identifying an individual under the laws of some jurisdictions.

Telemetry data, including personal identifiable information, may be used and shared by Provider and the MOC Alliance Collaborators. Provider and the MOC Alliance Collaborators may use telemetry data, including personal identifiable information, for a variety of purposes including operating, maintaining and improving the Services, research (including for peer review, or other similar purposes), and for any purpose for which you may consent. Provider, MOC Alliance Collaborators, or a research organization may also publicly post and make broadly available for download telemetry data in an anonymized manner on the Internet.

## Limitation of Liability

The Provider will use reasonable security measures to protect User Content from unauthorized access. However, the Provider makes no guarantees that the Services will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses, interference, hacking, unauthorized access, or other security intrusion, and the Provider disclaims any liability relating thereto.

AS PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROVIDER AND THE MOC COLLABORATORS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE (A) RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, (B) BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LMITATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR (C) ARISING FROM ANY OTHER CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. THE PROVIDER’S AND THE MOC COLLABORATORS’ TOTAL LIABILTY IN ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED US $10.00. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE LIABILTIY EXCEEDING SUCH AMOUNT AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. FURTHERMORE, FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, THE PROVIDER AND THE MOC COLLABORATORS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN RELATION TO THE LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OF USER CONTENT.

## Provider’s Right to Update Services and this Agreement

The Provider reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services, with or without notice and without liability to you, but, if practicable, Provider will try to provide you with notice of such change to the Services. ‍The Provider may from time to time, but has no obligation to, provide enhancements or improvements to the features/functionality of the Services, which may include patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades and other modifications (“Updates”). Updates may modify or delete certain features and/or functionalities of the Services. You agree that Provider has no obligation to (i) provide any Updates, or (ii) continue to provide or enable any particular features and/or functionalities of the Services to you.

The Provider reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Services.

## Termination of the Agreement

This Agreement may be terminated by you at any time by discontinuing your use of the Service and deleting your User Content or by written notice to the Provider’s technical/support contact listed here. In such an event, the Provider may immediately delete your account, but it may take up to four (4) weeks to do so. You should ensure prior to termination that you have transferred all data stored on the Services to another storage medium.

This Agreement may be terminated by the Provider for any or no reason by providing at least 48 hours’ notice to you. In such an event, you will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to retrieve your User Content from the Services. If your account access has been suspended pursuant to the “Enforcement” Section of this Agreement, you may request to retrieve your User Content from the Services by emailing Provider’s technical/support contact listed here. The Provider will take reasonable steps to arrange for you to retrieve such User Content, provided retrieval does not require an unreasonable amount of Provider’s time or resources and that the User Content does not violate the terms of this Agreement. Any such retrieval shall be at your own expense.

## Severability

If any part of this Agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.

## Governing Law

This Agreement, and the interpretation, construction and enforceability hereof, and all rights and obligations of both you and the Provider, whether arising under this Agreement or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to its principles of conflict of laws.
